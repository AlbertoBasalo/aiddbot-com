## The problem with coding agents at scale

Modern agents are impressive for isolated features or small apps. Under real project conditions, three failure modes emerg, but AI-Driven Development (AIDD) can solve them all:

| Failure | What it looks like | AIDD |
|---|---|---|
| **Detail or invent** | Critical context is missing — or fabricated convincingly. | _Spec Driven Development_|
| **Rules or chaos** | Code that violates your standards or is unmaintainable. | _Rules over Tools_|
| **Verify or hope** | Errors compound silently until they're expensive to fix. | _Human in the Loop_ |

`AIDDbot` implements all three AI-DD principles to aid you solve them all.

## What you get

A set of skills you invoke directly — or let your agent trigger:

> See the full [AIDD Workflow](/docs/AIDD.workflow.md) for a visual overview of the skills catalog.

### Architecture documentation

Run the architect skills once to set up your project context. A single mode-aware flow — prescriptive when you start fresh, descriptive when there is existing code to read:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/establish` | Product, paths, personality and git rules (C4 L1) |
| `/explore` | System architecture and ADRs (C4 L2) |
| `/excavate` | Tier/component architecture and the ER model (C4 L3) |
| `/extract` | Coding rules and conventions, one file per tier |

> See [Architect Pipelines](/docs/architect.pipelines.md) for a visual overview.

### Building features

And then, for every new feature use the following skills in order:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/specify` | Writes clear specifications with formal acceptance criteria |
| `/planify` | Breaks specs into concrete, ordered implementation steps |
| `/codify` | Generates code that follows your plans and your rules |
| `/verify` | Writes and runs E2E tests so specs are actually met |

> See [Builder Pipelines](/docs/builder.pipelines.md) for a visual overview.

### Crafting your own future

Roadmap to the future. Some are a work in progress, not yet available:

| Skill | What will it do |
|---|---|
| `/review` | Audits a11y, security, and performance, fixing findings in place |
| `/refactor` | Improves existing code without changing its behavior |
| `/release` | Prepares and publishes a new release, including changelog generation |

> See [Craftsman Pipelines](/docs/craftsman.pipelines.md) for a visual overview.

## Get started in 2 steps

Skills are plain markdown files — no package to install, no binary to run.

### 1. Clone into your project
From inside your destination repository root, clone this repo.

`git clone https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot AIDDbot-tmp`

Then move the `.agents` folder to your project root and delete the temporary clone:

```bash
# Bash (macOS/Linux/Git Bash)
cp -r AIDDbot-tmp/.agents ./.agents
rm -rf AIDDbot-tmp
```

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
Copy-Item -Path AIDDbot-tmp/.agents -Destination ./.agents -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path AIDDbot-tmp -Recurse -Force
```

### 2. Establish your environment

Run the architect skills once. A single mode-aware flow handles both fresh and existing codebases:

```markdown
/establish → /explore → /excavate → /extract
```

```markdown
`/establish` this project
> product, paths, personality and git rules
`/explore` this codebase
> system architecture and ADRs
`/excavate` each tier
> tier/component architecture and ER model
`/extract` from this source code
> coding rules and conventions
```

---

## Then, build features you can trust

To build every new feature, run those skills in order:

```markdown
/specify → /planify → /codify -> /verify
```

You can check the output of each step. Remember, Human in the loop! 

```markdown
`/specify`  a feature requirement
> formal spec with acceptance criteria
`/planify`  the specification
> clear, ordered implementation plan
`/codify`   the plan
> code that follows your rules
`/verify`   the code
> E2E tests that confirm specs are met
```

### Finally craft quality software with confidence

After building, run:

```markdown
`/review`   the source code
> audits a11y, security, and performance; fixes findings in place
`/refactor` the codebase
> better structure and maintainability
`/release`  a new version
> documentation and version control updates
```

## The AIDD philosophy

**AI-Driven Development** blends AI capabilities with proven software engineering practices. `AIDDbot` is built on three principles:

- **Human in the loop** — You are the decision-maker. You own every line of code.

- **Rules over tools** — Agents should follow your guidelines, not their own defaults.

- **Spec-driven development** — Define the problem precisely before any code is written.

---

### Who this is for

- Teams frustrated by agents that generate plausible-but-wrong code
- Engineers who want AI acceleration without sacrificing code quality
- Projects where standards, consistency, and verifiability actually matter
